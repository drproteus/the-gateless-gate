# Who Is He?

Hoen said: "The past and future Buddhas, both are his servants. Who is he?"

> Mumon's comment: If you realize clearly who he is, it is as if you met your own father on a busy street. There is no need to ask anyone whether or not your recognition is true.

Do not ride another's horse.
Do not discuss another's faults.
Do not interfere with another's work.
