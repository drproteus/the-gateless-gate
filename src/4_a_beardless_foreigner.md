# A Beardless Foreigner

Wakuan complained when he saw a picture of bearded Bodhidharma: "Why hasn't that fellow a beard?"

> Mumon's comment: If you want to study Zen, you must study it with your heart. When you attain realization, it must be true realization. You yourself must have the face of the great Bodhidharma to see him. Just one such glimpse will be  enough. But if you say you met him, you never saw him at all.

```
One should not discuss a dream
In front of a simpleton.
Why has Bodhidharma no beard?
What an absurd question!
