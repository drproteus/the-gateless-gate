# This Mind Is Not Buddha

A monk asked Baso: "What is Buddha?"

Baso said: "This mind is not Buddha."

> Mumon's comment: If anyone understands this, he is a graduate of Zen.

```
If you meet a fencing-master on the road, you may give him your sword,
 If you meet a poet, you may offer him your poem.
 When you meet others, say only a part of what you intend.
 Never give the whole thing at once.
```
