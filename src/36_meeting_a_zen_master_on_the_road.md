# Meeting a Zen Master on the Road

Goso said: "When you meet a Zen master on the road you cannot talk to him, you cannot face him with silence. What are you going to do?"

> Mumon's comment: In such a case, if you can answer him intimately, your realization will be  beautiful, but if you cannot, you should look about without seeing anything.

```
Meeting a Zen master on the road,
 Face him neither with words nor silence.
 Give him an uppercut
 And you will be called one who understands Zen.
```
